# Sample Application (FluxPilot)

This folder contains Kubernetes manifests for a sample application
used to demonstrate GitOps-based deployment using FluxPilot.

## Purpose
The sample application helps illustrate how application configurations
are stored in Git and automatically synchronized to the cluster.

## What belongs here
- deployment.yaml
- service.yaml
- kustomization.yaml

## Notes
This is a demonstration application. The same structure can be reused
for real applications with minimal changes.
